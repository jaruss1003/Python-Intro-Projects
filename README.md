# Python Intro Projects üêç

This repository contains a collection of small Python projects completed while learning programming fundamentals.  
Each project demonstrates key concepts such as variables, control flow, functions, loops, lists, basic algorithms, and simple user interaction.  

The goal of this repo is to showcase my hands-on practice as I build a foundation in Python for future applications in **data science, applied mathematics, and AI/ML engineering**.
